# Argos-Product-Scrapper-Category-Wise

There will be a variable 'parentURL' that contains a link to the category of argos.co.uk
You just need to change the category link, and run the code.
It will generate an EXCEL file with Products' Attributs.

This code was specifically meant to scrape the product falling under KIDS' BEDS. 
So, in order to change the category, you ofcourse have to make some amends.

Thanks,
Faizan
